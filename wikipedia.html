        <h2> 2007 World Cup </h2>
        <p> Preparations for the 2007 <b>Cricket World Cup</b> improved as India recorded identical 3â€“1 victories over <b>West Indies</b> and <b>Sri Lanka</b> and Dhoni had averages in excess of 100 in both these series.</p>
        <p> India unexpectedly crashed out of the World Cup after losses to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the group stage. Dhoni was out for a duck in both these matches and scored just 29 runs in the tournament. After the loss to <b>Bangladesh</b> in <b>2007 Cricket World Cup</b>. the house that Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalised and damaged by political activists of <b>JMM</b>. The local police arranged for security for his family as India exited the World Cup in the first round.</p>
        <p> Dhoni put his disappointing performances in the World Cup behind him by scoring 91* against <b>Bangladesh</b>, after India were left in a tight spot earlier in the run-chase. Dhoni was declared the Man of the Match for his performance, his fourth in ODI cricket. He was also later adjudged the Man of the Series after the third game of the series was washed away. Dhoni had a good Afro-Asia Cup, scoring 174 runs in 3 matches at an average of 87.00, with a blitzkrieg 139 not out off 97 balls, a Man of the Match innings, in the third ODI.</p>
